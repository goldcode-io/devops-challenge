Build the infrastructure of this API the way you want, you can use Docker Compose, AWS or any other way you like, the goal here is to analyze your commits to understand the way you work.

You have one week to complete the test, when you're done send an email to [anderson.lima@shawandpartners.com](mailto:anderson.lima@shawandpartners.com)
We will schedule a meeting for you to explain your solution

```
